# elm-starter

Just another starter boilerplate.

Hoping to add things I like to use regularly so I don't have to go find them in random repositories and wire them up. The intent here is that I can go from idea to working prototype quickly as I already most things ready to go.

Features I want to add
-- Common UI Components / Animations / Assets
-- Saving App state to Local Storage
-- Loading and parsing some data from an JSON endpoint
-- Parcel & Docker for packaging and distribution  

Disclaimer: Don't expect anything here to stay the same. You are welcome to use this however you like, also please send PR's and feedback.
